**Task 1 — Data dashboard**

Create a React app (Vite or CRA). I’ll use Vite in examples (faster).

Fetch the API (they gave the curl + API key).

Transform & analyze the hourly data (totals, peaks, moving average, anomalies).

Build an interactive dashboard: overview cards, line chart (upward/downward), stacked bar or area, hour heatmap, peak-hour highlights and anomaly list.

**Task 2 — AI Test Generator**

Build a small Node.js CLI/web endpoint that sends the code snippet to an LLM and returns generated tests.

Carefully craft the prompt (system + user messages) to direct the LLM to produce Jest + React Testing Library tests for React components, include edge cases, and only output a code block.

Run the tool against the two provided snippets, show raw output, critique it, and produce final refined tests.
